# Tip-Calculator
I've combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this fun and interactive tool that helps you calculate tips effortlessly. 
It's a simple yet practical application that demonstrates basic web development skills. 
A tip calculator helps users quickly and accurately calculate the appropriate amount of tip to leave at a restaurant or for other services.
